Meeting Number: #4 Date: 06/02/15, 12.00 – 12.30pm [WITH SUPERVISOR, follow up meeting]
Members in Attendance: Full House (Owen, Luke, James, Alex, Kat)	Apologies: N/A
Presented Progress: All group members have completed a rough draft of the proposal work and uploaded it onto the project’s SkyDrive account. References have been collected by all members for use in supporting the rationale of the project. 	Suggestions for Improvement of Pre-Existing Work: 
The supervisor’s advice was to use the introduction to set the scene by highlighting the issue the group would focus on. The risk of not being able to meet for part of the project’s time should also be quantified and dealt with. 
Discussed Items: 
	 Talked through our rationale and logic for the project. This should be used as the basis for the introduction. 
	The supervisor suggested researching into what software would be appropriate and needed to build the website and the database. Dreamweaver was suggested and disputed for the website, as well as MySql for the database. The supervisor stressed the importance of having the users add the content. 
	The supervisor suggested discussing the Belbin test results for future reference to make delegating roles in a sensible manner easier. 
	When discussing the plan it was mentioned that the entire development cycle needs to be included. Therefore the group would benefit from reading the brief for assignment two on its release (the co-ordinator should be reminded if necessary!)
	It was suggested that the team should exchange telephone numbers as a secondary means of communication. 
	The supervisor suggested the aim or issue for discussion in the introduction might need to be narrowed down in order to make it clearer what issue the project is really trying to solve. 
	The academic literature section needs to use references in the Harvard style. This will give the project a ‘real-world context’. A couple of references can be used in the introduction to support figures used and statements made where necessary. 
	Hand-in for total project is the 16th April. The work should ideally be finished for the week previous, as the hand-in is immediately after returning from the Easter holiday. The group therefore needs to compensate for this by employing a quick build strategy and returning a week early. This could be added in to the risk assessment as it should be considered and accommodated for. 
	Due to the time limitations of the project, the group can start looking into the completion of paper prototypes. Multiple delivery points or ‘milestones’ need to be built into the plan. The supervisor suggested a four week sprint. 
	The supervisor queried what the team’s plan for version control was. GitHub was mentioned as the main choice, but the group needs to become familiar with its commands and operations, although a group repository does exist. 
	The supervisor advised that the division of work could be done between the front end and the back end of the database.   
	Deadline for 09/02/15 – have revisions on the draft of the proposal completed. This needs to be ready and compiled for 12/02/15, to show to the supervisor. 

FOLLOW UP MEETING
	Elements of the project to be included in the plan: database schema design, text content to go on the website pages, website design, testing, login functions. 
	Further research needed for the antivirus comparison. Page could potentially allow the results to be sorted by price or another distinguishing feature. 
	Features included in each sprint will be decided by a MoSoCoW definition. Must have features include the comparison of antivirus software, the forum, and the login features. This will cover the database and the website design, and these features will be included in the first sprint. The secondary sprint will include the FAQ and the troubleshooting page, in addition to the newsfeed. 
	The first sprint is set for 2 weeks in length, with a third week as a buffer. This will cover the must have features of the website. The second sprint will also last two weeks to two and a half weeks, and cover the ‘should haves’. This will leave a week for polishing the final product. 
	The team should also consider creating paper prototypes to test on a variety of people. Having a team and therefore multiple designs could allow a more comparative approach to be taken, and have participants discriminate between different designs. 
Agreed Action: 
	Polish and redraft the proposal work to show to the supervisor on Friday. 
	Examine the brief for the project itself once it is released and incorporate the Gantt chart for the plan. 
	If possible, create a rough paper prototype. 	Next Meeting: 09/02/15, 11a.m., library (currently undesignated)
