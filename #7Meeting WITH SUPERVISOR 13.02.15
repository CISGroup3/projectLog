Meeting #7, 13/02/15 [with supervisor]

Members in Attendance: All present
Apologies: None 

The group met with the supervisor to go over the first draft of the proposal. The supervisor suggested several improvements that could be included. Firstly, the aims and objectives need to be retooled. Simply put, they need to be adapted so that the aim is presented as a unified, clear statement. At the moment this is best demonstrated through the paragraph describing the ‘primary objective’. In order to bring focus to the document, it would be beneficial to break the text up into bullet points. The aims and objectives also require a statement of who the ‘users’ described are, which is currently ambiguous. A useful approach could be to address the term ‘novice users’ and what it means for the project. In order to accurately describe this, the security requirements of novice users needs to be elicited from a representative sample. 
The same process needs to be applied to the objectives. Part of this could be done by evaluating the currently available equivalent resources (i.e. other websites aiming to meet the same need or present similar features) to show the similarities of them to the current project aim, and how the project aims to provide something different. The aims and objectives should also include how we intend to do that, and can reference the format, programs and languages we intend to use. 
As a general rule, both the aims and the objectives need to have information filtered down to better suit the format. As there are several security issues, there is the ongoing problem of informing users about all of them to the same standard. The context of the aim and objectives should have been provided in the introduction, and this provides the setup for the examination of what the group will deliver through the project. 
The supervisor suggested that the introduction needs to be bolder, and makes statements as to what the problem is and how the solution will attempt to address that problem. In addition to this, parts using phrases like ‘We as a group’ and ‘We felt’ should be rephrased to improve the flow of the piece. Besides this, the introduction needs to serve as a general entry point to talking about the main problems and issues raised, particularly the myriad of current security problems. In other words, the main issue or focus of the project needs to be introduced and substantiated using academic literature. As in the aims and objectives, the actual needs of the target audience need to be addressed. In addition to this, the last paragraph needs to be altered, as it does not flow naturally on from the rest of the piece. 
Outside of the introduction, the proposal needs to avoid ‘patchwork syndrome’, where putting together the disparate elements results in redundant repetition, for example if the activities that need to be added to the plan were mentioned multiple times in the introductory sections. 
In terms of the academic literature section, the points need joining together more, as they are currently disconnected from one another. The group also needs to ensure consistency between the plan and the WBS, as they should be consistent with one another. Additionally, the plan needs to include time for evaluating and preparing for the group presentation. In terms of formatting, landscape orientation could be employed here also to make the Gantt chart easier to read. 
For the plan itself, the supervisor suggested some minor alterations such as having two sprints only, as sprints should be limited to the building of the artefact itself and not the documentation surrounding it. In addition to this, timeboxing should be applied to ensure that the prototypes of the program are brought up to speed quickly. It would also be advisable to display the delegation of tasks to each group member on the plan. 
For the risk matrix, a few minor changes were suggested. Firstly, the matrix needs to be upfront about what languages and programs will be used, and take account of the learning curve, as difficulty with mastering an adequate skill level with new software and programming languages poses a threat to the successful completion of the project. The risks should be directly related to the project throughout. Besides this, the risk matrix should also include information on the ‘worst case scenario’ – in other words, if a risk did occur and couldn’t be averted, what would be the last resort for dealing with it? It is necessary to include a means of handling this as a way of ensuring that even a basic version of the final product can be produced and delivered. 
In addition to this the risk matrix should mention how risks are backed up using concrete examples. In other words, it needs to be specific to the project and show how risk has been handled so far. These risks need to apply explicitly to the project. An example of this includes backing up to the group drive. The group discussed setting a formal policy of perhaps backing up once a week after work on the project begins. 
Finally, a small change is needed for the reference section – where a citation comes from the same source, it needs to be split into articles A and B. 
Each member of the group will add improvements to their section of the proposal. The group will meet again on Monday, then on Friday. Initial design work should be started in the meantime. The mark allocation will be completed during the next meeting. 
 
Decisions Made: 

The group will:

1) Improve their parts of the draft proposal. 
2) Begin initial design work. 
3) Research into needed languages and programs. 

Work and task allocations: 

Assigned to: Everyone

Complete points 1-3 on the Decisions Made.

Deadlines Met: 

The references section and plan have been altered for the completion of the initial draft. 

Progress in achieving each objective: 

The first draft of the proposal has nearly been fully completed, and progress on the design work can begin parallel to the completion of the proposal.
