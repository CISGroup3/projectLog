Meeting #6, 11/02/15 
Members in Attendance: All present
Apologies: None 

Progress from the last meeting was reviewed – it was commented that delegation of the tasks needed to be added in to the project plan. The group felt that it would be more prudent to do this according to the capabilities and preferences of the individual members, rather than using the Belbin test results. It was proposed that the team could have a ‘floating member’ who could change from the website design to the database implementation if needed. This means that if one aspect of the project progresses more slowly or quickly than expected, resources can be distributed to where they are most needed.  

Further to this, the length needed to complete the database schema design was debated as being too long, and it was agreed to drop the length back to being three days only. There had been a gap in the plan as a way of attempting to ensure that a new sprint would not start on a weekend when the group was not together, but due to changes in the length of the database design task, this should not be a problem on the adapted plan. Other sections of the proposal have also been saved to the shared drive, so the project now needs to be compiled and completed. A draft layout for the mark allocation has also been created, and saved to the drive, but this will be done at a later date to allow a fairer representation of the group’s progress.
  
It was also queried as to how the group would test the program on the server. However, the university should have the provisions to provide server space, and this should be looked into before the building stages of the program are undertaken. The group also debated how to integrate the user’s involvement in a forum. It was commonly agreed that this would be achieved through having a user login. However, this also means that a means needs to be provided to give the user a new password if they forget their old one through an automatic reset link. This could be achieved through an automated script and will require further research. Providing the user with profile pages also needs to be added to the plan, and has been given an allotment of five days for completion.

The group then gave rough assignments for the project. Owen and James will work on the website, and Luke and Katriona will work on the database. Alex will act as a floating member and move between the divisions as necessary. The group then discussed the completion of the academic references section and compiled the resources that everyone had collected into one, to be finished outside of the meeting and neatened up then. The general categories used from before were kept and the most useful references added in to those categories. 

The group felt that the last part of the proposal, namely the mark allocation, could not be completed until near hand in time. However, the appendix clearly shows that there have been no absences left unaccounted for, and the group has not missed any of the assigned deadlines. The group will thus complete their academic review section, email it to Bridget before Friday’s meeting, and begin the design work the following Monday. James has already sent apologies for this meeting, but could be conferenced in using Skype. Holding the meeting on Tuesday instead was discussed as a possible option. 
Decisions Made: 
The group will:
1) Shorten the planned allocation for design of the database schema from a week to three days. 
2) Alter the plan so no gaps between schemas remain. 
3) Individually polish the references included to finish the academic literature section.
4) Compile their final work into the first draft.

Work and task allocations: 

Assigned to: Everyone

1) Review the references they found for the academic literature section and complete this section for the draft. 

Assigned to: Alex

1) Make alterations to the plan as discussed in the meeting. 

Deadlines Met: 

All draft work is now complete. 

Progress in achieving each objective: 

The project proposal is now largely complete and just needs presenting to the supervisor. After this small refinements can be made, the mark allocation added and the design work can begin.
